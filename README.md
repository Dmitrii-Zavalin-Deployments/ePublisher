## Guidelines for Adding Content to Publish

- Post images should be in `.png` format: `/content/images/<file.png>`.  
- Use the **same file names** for image, text, link, and hashtag for each post. Example:  
  - `/content/images/0.png`  
  - `/content/text/0.txt`  
  - `/content/links/0.txt`  
  - `/content/hashtags/0.txt`  
- Name the files with numbers (e.g., `0`, `1`, `2`). Use the **maximum number in the folder + 1** for naming new files.
